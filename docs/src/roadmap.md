# Roadmap
This page documents some planned work for RecurrentLayers.jl.
Future work for this library includes additional cells such as:

 - Unitary recurrent neural networks
 - Linear recurrent neural networks
 - Quasi recurrent neural networks

Additionally, some cell-independent architectures are also planned,
that expand the ability of recurrent architectures and could theoretically take
any cell:

 - Clockwork rnns
 - Segment rnn
 - Fast-Slow rnns
